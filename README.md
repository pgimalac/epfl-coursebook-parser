# epfl-coursebook-parser
Parser for the coursebook pages of the degrees at EPFL.

## Parser
The parser is a Python notebook, which, from the URL of the wanted coursebook, builds the list of courses, with various information.

## Spreadsheet
The spreadsheet is generated by the notebook. Its purpose is to easily manage and visualize the credits taken each semester.

## Disclaimer
The code has only been tested on the Computer Science Master coursebook, but it is expected to work on other coursebooks as well.
